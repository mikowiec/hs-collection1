\section{Overview}

    This section contains a short overview of our approach to plant
    simulation, focusing on high-level motives behind the design.


\subsection{Realism}


    To catch the immense complexity of real plants i an actually
    usable system would be impossible, since that would require
    simulation at least on the level of individual cells. To reach
    manageable complexity we work instead on the level of major parts
    of a plant, such as a branch or a leaf. While not completely
    realistic from a biologic viewpoint, our simulations are capable
    of producing visually convincing plant models, both static and
    animated.


    The challenge is to find the aspects of nature which are relevant
    for the result of the models, to find a level on which processing
    time is acceptable and yet the appearance implies an underlying
    natural regulating system.
    
    The relevant forces of nature have been separated and
    collected in a set which is deployed on the tree during each
    step.


\subsection{Simplifications}

    In addition to working on a rather high structure level, we make a
    number of other simplifications regarding the nature of biological
    plants. 

    Physical limitations are one aspect which is very expensive to
    account for exactly (since that would require detailed
    calculations of geometric appearance in every step of the
    simulation), but also of surprisingly little importance to
    realism, hence we allow ourselves to break physical restrictions
    either only during parts of simulation, or completely.

% \subsection{Environmental factors}
% 
% 
%     To make the biological complexity manageable the model is kept very
%     simple, while allowing for a few interesting interactions with the
%     environment.
%     The environment of the simulation is approximated by four
%     factors, temperature, sunlight, substance levels and physical
%     structure of the surroundings.
% 
%     Some or all of the environmental factors may vary over time. 
%     Either because of external changes such as different seasons or
%     internal changes caused by the actual simulation (shading, water
%     consumption, collision between large branches, ...)
%      
% 
% \subsubsection*{Temperature}
% 
%     An average temperature for the global world is maintained, local
%     changes are not taken into account.
% 
% 
% \subsubsection*{Sunlight}
% 
%     Each point in the world can be queried for the direction towards
%     the sun and the intensity of the light. Since these properties
%     changes wildly even for shorter periods, they may be approximated
%     either by a simple average or a sampling of real values which 
%     are adapted for the simulation.
% 
% \subsubsection*{Substance levels}
% 
%     (currently only an generalized``power'') \\
%     Each point in the world, air as well as soil, can be queried for the
%     concentration of power available for consumption by the plant.
%     This generic ``power'' can of course be split up in a number of
%     resources such as water and minerals to allow for more detailed
%     simulations, if need arises.
% 
% 
% \subsubsection*{Physical structure}
% 
%     Each point in the world can be queried whether it is free (in
%     the air) or contained by some structure (soil, rocks,
%     plants...). To guide the simulation a vector pointing towards
%     the closest surface to a given point is also available. 
% 
% 
% \subsection{Feedback and limitations}
% 
%     As mentioned above, an extremely detailed model of the world is
%     not realistic in a realtime simulation, especially modifications
%     of the environment caused by the simulated plants is heavily
%     simplified. Water levels and light is accounted for in big blocks,
%     shading is very limited and coarse, small structures are ignored
%     for collision detection, and so on...
% 
%     However, even rather simple models give rise to quite natural and
%     interesting behaviour of the simulated plants.
